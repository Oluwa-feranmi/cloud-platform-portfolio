This repository is a curated portfolio of hands-on **AWS Cloud, DevOps, SRE, and Platform Engineering** projects.  
The goal is to demonstrate **production-ready infrastructure**, **automation**, **scalability**, **reliability**, and **operational best practices** in AWS environments.

---

## 👋 About Me

I am a Cloud / DevOps / Platform Engineer with expertise in **AWS** and a focus on:

- Designing and deploying **AWS infrastructure** using CloudFormation
- Building scalable, resilient, and automated systems
- CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Monitoring, observability, and reliability best practices
- Learning and experimenting with Terraform and other IaC tools

This portfolio showcases **practical, production-oriented projects** rather than tutorials.
