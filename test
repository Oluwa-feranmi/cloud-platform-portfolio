## Introducing Today's Project!

### What is Docker?

Docker is an application that lets me package and build custom images, which  
can then be deployed. It manages images for me as well, and it is useful  
because it helps package the application and dependencies so that the app  
works on all servers correctly. I used Docker in this project to run my custom  
image.

### One thing I didn't expect ...

One thing I didn't expect in this project was seeing how quick it is to deploy an  
application using Elastic Beanstalk.

### This project took me ...

This project took me approximately 2 hours, including demo and troubleshooting  
time. The challenging part was when I was running into errors on Beanstalk  
because of IAM policies. It was most rewarding to see my web app being  
deployed live.

## Understanding Containers and Docker

### Containers

Containers are tools for packaging applications in a way that is easy for  
developers to run. They are useful because it helps developers/engineers to  
share their work more efficiently.

A container image is a built Dockerfile.

### Docker

Docker is a platform for creating and managing containers. Docker Desktop is a  
software for using Docker; it makes working with Docker easy.

The Docker daemon is the engine for Docker that receives commands sent  
through clients (for example, clicks in the docker desktops or text commands  
sent in the terminal), and it creates and manages the containers.

## Running an Nginx Image

Nginx is a proxy web server that helps with serving web content.

The command I ran to start a new container was `docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx`.  
`-d` means I am running the application in the background, and I am matching the  
host port 80 to the container's port 80, which is why I ran `-p 80:80.`

### Creating a Custom Image

The Dockerfile contains the instructions that tell Docker how to build my custom  
container image.

My Dockerfile tells Docker three things:  
1. The custom container image uses the latest version of the nginx container image at its base  
2. Then it makes modifications by replacing the default nginx welcome page with my custom `index.html`  
3. It then tells Docker: *The container listens on port 80.*

Port 80 is the default HTTP port for web servers (like Nginx).

The command I used to build a custom image with my Dockerfile was:

```
docker build -t my-web-app .
```

The `.` at the end tells Docker to look at the current working directory for the instructions.  
Docker automatically scans for a file named `Dockerfile` unless I specify `-f`.

## Running My Custom Image

There was an error when I ran my custom image because I tried to map to the  
container's port 80, but a running container was already using port 80. I resolved  
this by stopping the running container so I could start the new one.

In this example:

- The **container image** is the blueprint that tells Docker the application code,  
  dependencies, and libraries that should go into a container.  
- The **container** is the actual software created from this image, running the  
  web server displaying your `index.html` file.

## Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service that makes it easy to deploy cloud  
applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. You simply  
upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk handles everything needed to get it  
running, like setting up servers and managing scaling.

Deploying my custom image with Elastic Beanstalk took me about 10 minutes in  
total, including launching the environment.

## Deploying App Updates

To learn how to deploy app updates with Elastic Beanstalk, I updated my app by  
adding a new line of code alongside an image. I verified those changes by  
opening the `index.html` file in my browser.

My app updates didn't show up immediately because I had to wait for the  
environment to change from grey to green. To deploy changes, I used the  
**Upload and deploy** button.
